# System Design - SecureVote

## Architecture Overview

SecureVote is a decentralized e-voting system built on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability of votes.

### Key Components

1. Smart Contracts (Ethereum)
   - VotingSystem.sol: Core voting logic
   - ElectionFactory.sol: Election creation and management
   - VoterRegistry.sol: Voter registration and verification

2. Backend API (Node.js/Express)
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Election management
   - Vote encryption and submission
   - Integration with blockchain

3. Frontend (Next.js)
   - User interface for voters and administrators
   - Wallet integration
   - Real-time updates
   - Vote casting interface

### Security Features

1. End-to-end encryption
2. Zero-knowledge proofs for vote verification
3. Blockchain immutability
4. Multi-factor authentication
5. Smart contract auditing

### Data Flow

1. User Registration and Authentication
2. Election Creation
3. Vote Casting
4. Vote Verification
5. Result Tabulation
